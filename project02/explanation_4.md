# Active Directory - Explanation

The Active Directory problem was implemented by iterating recursively a hierarchical tree structure. For this problem, we assume a cyclic nesting group is not part of the requirement as there was no mention of it. 

## Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity is $O(n)$, where `n` is the number of groups.
The space complexity is $O(n)$, where `n` is the number of groups.
